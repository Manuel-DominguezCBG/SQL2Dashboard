# SQL2Dashboard
## Working with databases and dashboards

This is a project as part of my learning in the STP. This project aims to overcome some of the competencies of the Computing **Computing for Clinical Scientists**. This work can be split in three main tasks:

1. Folder **Covid-19**. From datasets with Covid-19 data, I have create a database. With this database I have desinged a dashboard. This folder contained:

```sh
├── COVID-19_data_to_dashboard.ipynb            # A JN where I explain how to create a database from CSV files
├── Data                                        # All data used to create this  COVID_19.db database
│   ├── COVID_19.db
│   ├── Deaths_within_28_days_of_positive.csv
│   ├── Patients_admitted_to\ hospital.csv
│   ├── People_tested\ positive.csv
│   ├── People_vaccinated.csv
│   ├── UK_total_cases.csv
│   ├── Virus_tested.csv
│   └── vaccinated_regions.csv
├── Images                                       # Some images for the notebooks
│   ├── screen.jpg
│   ├── screenshot-aca1dabf.png
│   └── screenshot-aca1dwwabf.jpg
├── assets                                       # This folder is needed to design the dashboard
│   ├── linkedin-logo2.png
│   ├── logo_hospital.png
│   └── wrgllogohighres.png
├── db2dashboard.py                               # The script to created the dashboard
└── tutorial.zip                                  # Many drafts and tutorial used to learn 
```

2.  Folder **Fake_database** A fake database has been created with a more elaborated tecnhical details in order to work with SQL commands and learn about how to link the tables. 
```sh
├── 1_Creating_the_fake_database.ipynb             # Where I have created the fake data and create a second database
├── 2_Database_manipulation.ipynb                  # To become familiar with SQL commands
├── 2fake_db.db                                    # The database created
├── Fake_db2dashboard.py                           # The script to created the second dashboard
├── assets
│   ├── linkedin-logo2.png
│   ├── logo_hospital.png
│   └── wrgllogohighres.png
└── tutorials.zip                                   # More draft code and tutorial to practice`
```
3. Folder **Testing**

4. Folder **A project plan**
