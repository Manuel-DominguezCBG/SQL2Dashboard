# A personal reflections on why test is important
****


This training project has allowed me to see the importance of ensuring as a bioinformatician that what the dashboard shows is faithful to the data contained in the database. When we are called to analyse and display data, users (medical staff or executives) will not look at the accuracy of our procedure. In a clinical context, erroneous decisions can be made from errors in the representation or analysis of the data having as consequence a negative impact in the patient. So as bioinformaticians we are responsable for data quality management.

For that reason I have wanted to ensure that the data display is correct. To do that and also discover defects or bugs in the software I have applied some tests. The idea is quite simple but put this into practice is very complicate especially for someone who has not applied testing in software development before.

Reading about this I have learnt that many steps can be made to solve this.

1. Identification of right data sources. In this learning project mistakes in the selection of the data (for example taking Covid data from Spain instead of the UK) would provide a different output in the graphics. Incorrect data may result from migration of data from one database to another, presence of incorrect values, or even time-bound data changes. It is important to identify the cause and fix it.

2. Reviewing is an efficient way to check the correctness of the data. That is in fact what I have tried to do by appliying the tests.

3. No applied in this learning project but in real scenarios I have reading about

 3.1 Secure and reliable systems for data storage, backups, and transfers

 3.2 Documented processes to reduce human error

 3.3 Adherence to data protection regulations such as GDPR

 3.4 Check constraints to require new data to be inputted in a certain form

Apart from all informatic skill in computing and databases manipulation, I have gained a better understanding of the importance of this and I will be aware in the future if I need to work with real databases
